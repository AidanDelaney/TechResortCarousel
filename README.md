The following tasks are designed to appeal to learners of the ages 8 through 18.  Furthermore, they are designed to require as little specialist client-side equipment as possible.  In general, they are a mix of digital story telling and basic software development tasks.  The key idea is to motivate learners to study more advanced software development.

Each task is broken into three sections:
  1. Go, go, technology!,
  2. Fused, and
  3. Super-fuesed.
Each subsequent section is intended to build on the previous section.  The first section introduces the technology, by example.  The second section directs learners to develop their skills using a particular technology and the final section widens the scope of interaction with technology.  In particular, we encourage learners to question the design and usability of the technology and to generally see how the technology can be deployed outside the narrow (but awesome) scope of software development.

## Stop Motion ##
This is intended as a task for younger learners.  The key task is to make a short stop motion film using a tablet computer and some pliable materials: building blocks, modelling clay, paper and colouring pencils.  Learners are encouraged to explore storytelling through stop motion filming.  The extensions ask the learner to design whole scenes and think critically about their workflow.  In particular, the software aspects of the workflow should be questioned and learners encouraged to suggest improvements to the software.

Equipment:

  * Tablet computer, preferably running Android or Firefox OS.
  * Building blocks such as Lego and MegaBloks.
  * Modelling clay such as plasticine or Play-Doh.
  * Large sheets of paper, say A3 size, for designing backdrops.
  * Pencils, colours and crayons.

## Mobile Temperature Reader ##
This is a mostly tactile and well scaffolded activity to integrate a sensor with a smartphone.  Here we provide a smartphone app that reads temperature data from a web service and ask the learner to construct the sensor used to record and upload the data.  The source code to read the sensor and upload the data is provided to the learner in a printed manual.  Extension to this task provide the source code to the smartphone app for the learner to modify.  Another extension point considers the design of the sensor as a home-automation style product.

Equipment:

  * Wireless and wired network access.
  * Server space to run temperature web service.
  * Arduino with ethernet shield.
  * Machine to run Arduino IDE.
  * LM35 temperature sensor.

## Programming First Steps ##
There are many ways to take first steps into programming.  For various reasons, we're using Scratch on the RaspberryPi.  This allows us to frame the "answer" of programming as a "question" about story telling i.e. given some virtual object and virtual characters, can the learner write and direct a short film.

Equipment:

  * RaspberryPi.
  * Audio speakers.
  * HDMI screen.
  * Keyboard and mouse.

## Mobile Game Development ##

Equipment:

  * Tablet computer, preferably running Android of FirefoxOS.
  * Developer machine -- requires installation of Android developer kit, node.js and some other things.

## System Operations ##

Equipment:

  * Reasonably taken apart server-class machine.
  * CentOS or Debian install USB disk.
  * Wired internet connection.
